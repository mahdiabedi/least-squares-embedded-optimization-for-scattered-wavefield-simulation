## ðŸ§  Overview

This work proposes a hybrid training strategy that embeds a least-squares optimization step within the training loop of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve the 2D acoustic Helmholtz equation more efficiently and in fewer epochs.

Key Features:
- Least-Squares-enhanced training for PINNs
- Varying collocation point strategy
- Comparison against traditional PINNs with validation data
- Application to simple and complex velocity models
